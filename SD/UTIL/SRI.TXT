===================================================================
                           Introduction
===================================================================

SofaRunIt is a MSX tool designed  to launch MSX disk images. It  is
based on NearDark "RunIt" tool, with many changes and improvements.

It features:

 * Support for file-based disk images (MSX-DOS and BASIC).

 * Support of both concatenated and individual disk images.

 * Support for mixed 360KB & 720KB concatenated disk images.

 * Keyboard or joystick on the fly disk change.

 * On the fly write protection change.

 * On the fly user disk creation.

 * Up to 20 disk images at the same time.

 * Support  for games  using memory  mapper, even  if your MSX does
   not have memory mapper read-back capabilities.

                           Requirements
===================================================================

MSX computer with MSX-DOS 2,  and 49152 RAM bytes free on the  main
slot. Type   "memory" on  the MSX-DOS  2 command  line to check how
much free RAM you have.

Games  using  memory  mapper (like  the  translated  version of  SD
Snatcher or the cracked Konami Game Collections) will require  more
memory.

                             Usage
===================================================================

Usage: SRI [options] <disk_image> ...

[options] can be one or more of:
  /Bx: Boot from disk x (1 = first)
  /C:  Simulate [CTRL] pressed (only one drive & more memory)
  /Dx: Delay disk operations (0..255)
  /F:  No memory mapper support
       (faster disk operations)
  /H:  Display this help
  /M:  Use Music Module as MSX Audio
  /N:  No screen change (keep palette)
  /R:  Make next images read-only
  /S:  Skip logo
  /W:  Make next images writable
  /Zx: Set CPU mode (turboR only)
    0: No change (default)
    1: Z80 (ROM)
    2: R800 ROM
    3: R800 DRAM

<disk_image> is a  disk image(s) file.  A <disk_image> can  contain
several concatenated disk images.

If preceded  by '+',  <disk_image> will  be created  on the  fly on
first  access,  as formatted  empty  720KB MSX-DOS  disk.  Only one
'+'<disk_image> is allowed.

Several <disk_image> can be specified, they will be added in order.

Following operations are available on disk access (CAPS led on):

Keyboard:

  [1]-[9]:          Select disk 1-9
  [0]:              Select disk 10
  [Shift]+[1]-[9]:  Select disk 11-19
  [Shift]+[0]:      Select disk 20
  [R]:              Make current disk read-only
  [W]:              Make current disk writable
 
Joystick disk selection:

  1. Keep (A) or (B) button pressed
  2. Press other button x times to select disk x (CAPS will blink)
  3. Release both buttons



===================================================================
                          Troubleshooting
===================================================================

Most issues are cause by either:

 * Not enough memory available. Try the /C option.
 
 * Too  fast disk  accesses. This  can cause  graphical glitches or
   even  game  crash. Try  the  /D option  to  slow down  the  disk
   accesses. Increase the value until game works.
   
 * Disk is  write protected.  Some games  require the  disk to   be
   write-enabled. Add the /W parameter before <disk_image>.

Even if everything has been  done for it, SofaRunIt can't  run 100%
of the games, because it's loaded  in RAM mapper and not in a  real
ROM slot. If the above solutions do  not work,  your problem  might
be caused  by  games  accessing directly  the  disk  ROM instead of
using  hooks, or  because of   your  memory  configuration    (most
of  the  times when you have multiple RAM slots). Those  issues are
usually  easy to patch.
