ATDIR                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      ATDIR +|-H [/H] [/P] compound-filespec

Purpose:     Changes  the  attributes  of directories to  make  them
        hidden/not hidden.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies the directories  whose
        attributes are to be changed.

             If  +H  is given,  then the  selected  directories  are
        marked  as  hidden,  and  will  not  be  affected  by  other
        directory  commands  or shown by a DIR command unless  a  /H
        option is given with those commands. The -H option marks the
        selected  directories as not hidden,  and will not have  any
        effect  unless  the  /H  option  is  given.  The  files  and
        directories   within  the  specified  directories  are   not
        affected.

             Unlike  files,  directories cannot  be made  read only,
        system directory or archived.

             When  an error occurs,  the erroneous directory name is
        printed followed by an error message,  and the command  will
        continue with the next directory. If many errors occur, then
        the  /P  option can be used to cause the output to pause  at
        the end of the screen.

             The  DIR /H command can be used to indicate the current
        attributes of directories.

Examples:

        ATDIR +H DIR1

             Marks the directory called DIR1 as hidden.

        ATDIR -H DIR1/H

             Marks the hidden directory DIR1 as not hidden.

        ATDIR +H DIR?

             Marks  all  directories matching DIR?  as  hidden  (for
        example DIR1, DIR2 and DIR3).

        ATDIR +H \DIR1+\DIR2

             Marks  the  DIR1 directory and the  DIR2  directory  as
        hidden.
