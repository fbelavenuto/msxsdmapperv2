CONCAT                                                    [Enhanced]
------

Format:      CONCAT [/S] [/H] [/P] [/A] [/B] [/V] source filespec

Purpose:     Concatenates (joins together) files or devices.

Use:         The definition of the source is:

                  compound-filespec

        The  compound-filespec specifies  the files  or devices that
        are to  be joined  together. /H  allows hidden  files to  be
        joined and /S allows system files to be joined.

             The  second  parameter  is  a  filespec  that  must  be
        unambiguous and is created before the source files are read.
        Each  source file is then read,  joined onto the end of  the
        previous one and written out to the destination.

             As each  source file  is read, its filename is printed.
        If  for some  reason the  file cannot be read (eg. it is the
        file  that  has been  created as  the destination)  then the
        filename  is  followed by  an error  message and  the CONCAT
        operation continues with the next source file. If many files
        are being  concatenated, then  /P will  cause the  output to
        pause at the end of the screen until a key is pressed.

             Normally,  the  concatenation  is  performed  on  ASCII
        files.  Source  files  are read up to the first  end-of-file
        character  (CTRL-Z)  and a single end-of-file  character  is
        appended to the destination after all data has been  written
        out.  If,  however,  /B is given,  then no interpretation is
        given to the data read and no additional data is added.

             It  is also possible to give the /B to the  destination
        or to any of the filespecs in the compound-filespec,  and it
        will then refer only to those files. /A may also be given to
        reverse the effect of /B.

             The  /V option can be given to turn write  verification
        on  for  the duration of the CONCAT command (see the  VERIFY
        command). This will ensure that data is written correctly to
        disks but will slow the operation down.

             If  CONCAT  gives  a 'Not  enough  memory'  error  then
        probably  reducing  the number of buffers (see  the  BUFFERS
        command)  or removing some environment items  (see HELP  ENV
        on Environment Items) will free up sufficient memory.

Examples:

        CONCAT *.DOC ALL.PRN

             A  new  file called ALL.PRN is created,  and all  files
        matching  *.DOC  (for  example  FILE1.DOC,   FILE2.DOC   and
        FILE3.DOC)  are joined together  and written to the new file
        in the order that they are found on disk.  Any existing file
        called ALL.PRN will be overwritten.

        CONCAT /H /P *.DOC ALL.DOC
        ALL.DOC -- Cannot concatenate destination file

             A  new  file called ALL.DOC is created,  and all  files
        matching  *.DOC are joined together and written to  the  new
        file  in  the order that they are found on disk.  Since  the
        destination  file ALL.DOC also matched the  source  filename
        *.DOC,  the message is printed and it is not included in the
        concatenation.

        CONCAT /B  FILE2.DOC + FILE3.DOC + FILE1.DOC  ALL.DOC

             A new file ALL.DOC is created, and the files FILE2.DOC,
        FILE3.DOC  and  FILE1.DOC and joined together in that  order
        and  written to the new file.  They are joined  together  in
        binary mode.
