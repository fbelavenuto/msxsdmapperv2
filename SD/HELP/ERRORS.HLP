ERRORS AND MESSAGES
-------------------

DISK ERRORS

             Disk   errors  occur  when  a  command  or  program  is
        attempting to access a disk and fails for some reason,  such
        as a disk not being in the drive. When this happens, message
        and  prompt appears which allows the user the  either  retry
        the  operation  which may now work (eg.  if a disk has  been
        inserted  into  the drive),  to ignore the operation  or  to
        abort the entire command.

             An example disk error message and prompt is as follows,
        and  may be given if the disk was taken out whilst drive  A:
        was being accessed:

                  Not ready reading drive A:
                  Abort, Retry or Ignore (A/R/I)?

        The  'not ready' part of the message indicates why the  disk
        operation failed, and other possibilities exist (see below).
        'reading' indicates that the command was trying to read  the
        disk,  and  may be replaced by 'writing' if that is what  it
        was  doing.  'drive  A:' is the drive in which the disk  was
        attempted to be accessed.

             The  'Abort,   Retry  or  Ignore'  part  indicates  the
        possible  actions that can be taken by the user,  and  these
        are selected by pressing the 'A',  'R' or 'I' key.

             If  Abort  is  selected,  then the  entire  command  is
        aborted and the message 'Disk operation aborted' is  printed
        before another command can be typed.

             If  Retry  is selected then the failed  disk  operation
        will  simply  be  retried and may fail again  or  may  work,
        particularly  if some corrective action has been taken  such
        as inserting a missing disk.

             Ignore  causes the failed disk operation to be  ignored
        by the command.  In many cases, ignoring an error may not be
        recommended  and in these cases the Ignore option  will  not
        even be displayed,  although it may still be selected. Doing
        so  may  however cause serious system malfunction and  could
        destroy  data  on the disk.  Even if the  Ignore  option  is
        displayed,  it should be used with extreme caution, and only
        when  all else fails.  Normally Ignore is only used when the
        data on a disk has got corrupted and ignoring the disk error
        offers the only possibility of recovering all or part of the
        data.

             A few serious errors which generally mean the disk  has
        been   corrupted  beyond  possible  use  are   automatically
        aborted,  and  just the appropriate error message is printed
        (eg. 'Bad file allocation table').

             The  possible errors that can occur as disk errors  and
        their meanings are, in alphabetical order, as follows:

        Bad file allocation table

             The  disk  contains  an invalid file  allocation  table
        (FAT).  The FAT is an area on disk in which the system keeps
        information  to tell it where on the disk the data  in  each
        file is stored.  Thus if the FAT is invalid,  it cannot read
        any  data at all.  This message usually means that the  disk
        has been corrupted beyond possible use.

        Cannot format this drive

             An  attempt  was made to format a disk in a drive  that
        does not support disk formatting. This probably means that a
        FORMAT command was given specifying the RAM disk.

        Data Error

             The data was read or written without error, but the CRC
        check  failed.   This  usually  means  the  disk  has   been
        corrupted.

        Disk error

             The data could not be read or written to the disk.

        Incompatible disk

             An  attempt was made to access an 80 track disk in a 40
        track drive or a double sided disk in a single sided  drive.
        This  basically  means that the disk is not compatible  with
        the drive.  Note that MSX-DOS can read a 40 track disk in  a
        80 track drive, but if the disk is written to in an 80 track
        drive  then it may not be possible to read it again in a  40
        track drive.

        Not a DOS disk

             The  disk is not a format that MSX-DOS  can  read.  For
        example,  although  MSX-DOS  can  execute CP/M  programs  it
        cannot access CP/M disks.

        Not ready

             The  disk is not in the drive being accessed.  The disk
        should be inserted into the drive and 'Retry' selected.

        Sector not found

             MSX-DOS  tried  to  read or  write  to  a  non-existent
        sector. May indicate that the disk has been corrupted.

        Seek error

             The  requested  track on the disk could not  be  found.
        Could mean a corrupted disk or faulty disk drive.

        Unformatted disk

             The disk has not been formatted. Use the FORMAT command
        on the disk before accessing it.

        Verify error

             Only  occurs  when verify is on,  and means  that  data
        appeared  to be written to disk successfully but  when  read
        back was found to be different to that written.

        Write error

             Data was not written correctly.

        Write protected disk

             The  disk is write protected and an attempt was made to
        write  data to it.  The disk should be made unprotected  and
        'Retry' selected.

        Wrong disk and Wrong disk for file

             MSX-DOS accessed a disk once and subsequently needed to
        access  it  again,  but  found that the  drive  contained  a
        different  one.  The  correct disk should  be  inserted  and
        'Retry' selected.

COMMAND ERRORS

             Command  errors occur when a command cannot perform its
        intended function for some reason.

             If  an error occurs in a command and it is unlikely  to
        be  able to continue,  then an appropriate error message  is
        printed, and the next command is read at the prompt.

             An example error message is:

                  *** File not found

             The  three asterisks *** are printed first to  indicate
        that  an  error has occurred.  The message is then  printed,
        followed by the normal command prompt on the next line.  The
        possible errors that can occur are listed below.

             When a command error occurs in a specific situation, an
        'error  type'  message  may also be  printed.  For  example,
        generally when a required file cannot be found on disk,  the
        'File not found' message is printed as in the above example.
        However,  if  the file required is a file specified  by  the
        redirection  symbol  <  (see  HELP  IO  on  Redirection  and
        Piping) then the message printed will be:

                  *** Redirection error: File not found

             The possible error types are:

        Batch file error:

             An  error  occurred  whilst attempting to read  from  a
        batch  file,  for example a disk error occurred and  'abort'
        was selected.

        Piping error:

             The error occurred during a piping operation,  probably
        in  connection  with the temporary files  that  COMMAND2.COM
        creates  (see  HELP  IO  on  Redirection  and  Piping).  For
        example,  the TEMP environment item did not refer to a valid
        drive or directory (see HELP ENV on Environment Items).

        Redirection error:

             The error occurred during a redirection operation.  For
        example,   an   invalid  filename  was  specified  after   a
        redirection symbol <,  > or >>,  or the specified input file
        was not found (see HELP IO on Redirection and Piping).

        Standard input error:

             An error occurred on the standard input to a command or
        program  after  redirection or piping has been set  up,  for
        example  the standard input has been redirected from a  file
        and the end of the file has been reached.

        Standard output error:

             An  error occurred on the standard output of a  command
        or program after redirection or piping has been set up,  for
        example  the standard output has been redirected to  a  file
        and the disk is full.

             Many commands  operate on  files or directories, and if 
        an  ambiguous filename is given then the command operates on 
        several files or directories (for example the REN command or 
        the COPY  command). Often  an error occurs when it is trying 
        to perform the command on one of the files, but which may be 
        successful  on one  of the  other files.  In this  case, the 
        filename is  printed followed  by the  error message and the 
        command then continues. For example:

                  COMMAND2.COM -- File cannot be copied onto itself

             The  possible command errors that can be given are,  in
        alphabetical order, as follows:

        Cannot concatenate destination file

             This error is given by CONCAT and means that one of the
        filenames  matched by the source file specification  is  the
        destination  file.  This  is not necessarily wrong  but  may
        indicate a mistake in the command.

        Cannot create destination file

             This  is  given by COPY,  and usually  means  that  the
        destination file for the file it is copying would, if it was
        created,  overwrite a file that was already in use.  This is
        likely to be a previously copied source file but may be some
        other file such as the currently executing batch file.

        Cannot overwrite previous destination file

             This is given by COPY,  and means that the  destination
        file  for the file it is copying would,  if it was  created,
        overwrite   the  destination  file  of  the  file  that  was
        previously  copied.  This  usually means that  the  intended
        destination   was  a  directory  but  that  it's  name   was
        misspelled.

        Cannot transfer above 64K

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Command too long

             A  command that was given is too long.  This  will  not
        occur when typing commands from the keyboard,  but may occur
        from  a batch file.  The maximum length of a command is  127
        characters after % parameter substitution.

        Ctrl-C pressed

             The command was interrupted by pressing CTRL-C.

        Ctrl-STOP pressed

             The command was interrupted by pressing CTRL-STOP.

        Directory exists

             A  command attempted to create a new file or  directory
        on disk with the same name as an existing directory.

        Directory not empty

             The RMDIR (RD) command tried to remove a directory that 
        contains files  or other  directories. These must be deleted 
        first with the DEL and RMDIR commands since directories must 
        be empty before they can be removed.

        Directory not found

             A  directory  command (eg.  RNDIR) could not  find  the
        specified directory.

        Disk full

             There  is no more room on the disk and files will  have
        to be deleted and the command given again.

        Disk operation aborted

             A  disk  error  occurred  and the  'Abort'  option  was
        chosen, thus aborting the whole command.

        Duplicate filename

             REN  or  RNDIR  cannot  perform  the  specified  rename 
        because  the new  filename is  the same  as a  filename that 
        already exists.  Also occurs  from MOVE  or MVDIR  because a 
        filename  already exists  in the  destination directory with 
        the same name as the file or directory being moved.

        End of file

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Environment string too long

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Error on standard input

             This should not normally occur from commands, and means
        that  an  error occurred while a command was  attempting  to
        read from the keyboard.

        Error on standard output

             This should not normally occur from commands, and means
        that  an  error occurred while a command was  attempting  to
        write to the screen.

        File access violation

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        File allocation error

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        File cannot be copied onto itself

             The  destination  file when trying to do a COPY is  the
        same file as the source.

        File exists

             MKDIR  (MD) tried to create a new directory but a  file
        with   the  same  name  already  exists  in  the   specified
        directory.

        File for HELP not found

             The HELP command looked for a file to get the help text
        from but could not find it. Help files are usually kept in a
        directory called \HELP on the boot disk.

        File handle has been deleted

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        File handle not open

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        File is already in use

             A command tried to modify a file that is already  being
        used for some other purpose, such as the currently executing
        batch file.

        File not found

             A command could not find the specified file or files.

        Internal error

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Invalid BDOS call

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Invalid attributes

             Usually means an invalid +/- attribute was specified in
        ATTRIB or ATDIR.

        Invalid date

             The  date  typed into the DATE command is not  a  valid
        date or was typed in in an invalid format.

        Invalid device operation

             A command  cannot perform  its function  on one  of the
        built-in system devices eg. a file cannot be renamed CON.

        Invalid directory move

             MVDIR attempted to move a directory into one of its own
        descendant directories, which cannot be done.

        Invalid drive

             A drive that does not exist was specified.

        Invalid environment string

             The  name  of  an  environment  item  contains  invalid
        characters.  Only  those  characters valid in filenames  are
        valid in environment item names.

        Invalid file handle

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Invalid filename

             A filename contains invalid characters.  This may be  a
        filename   explicitly  given,   or  may  be  the  result  of
        attempting to rename a file with an ambiguous new name.

        Invalid number

             A  number  given  in  a  command  contained   non-digit
        characters.

        Invalid option

             An  invalid  letter  was given after a / on  a  command
        line.

        Invalid . or .. operation

             A command  cannot perform  its function  on the special
        '.'  and '..'  directories that  are present at the start of
        all sub-directories.

        Invalid parameter

             The  parameter to a command is generally not valid  for
        that command in some way.

        Invalid pathname

             A path specified on a command line does not exist or is
        syntactically incorrect.

        Invalid process id

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Invalid sub-function number

             This should not normally occur from commands.

        Invalid time

             The  time  typed into the TIME command is not  a  valid
        time or was typed in in an invalid format.

        Missing parameter

             A command expected a parameter but did not find one.

        No spare file handles

             Should not normally occur from commands.

        Not enough memory

             Not  enough memory  is available for the given command.
        For example, a large program too large to fit into memory or
        not enough memory for a new environment string.

        Not enough memory, system halted

             This  special  error message is  printed  when  MSX-DOS
        attempts  to  start  up and finds that there is  not  enough
        memory to continue.  As the message suggests,  the  computer
        must then be reset. This should not normally occur.

        Pathname too long

             A  path is too long.  Either the length of the pathname
        given exceeds 100 characters,  or the total length of a path
        from  the  root  directory  to  a  file  is  more  than   63
        characters.

        RAM disk (drive H:) already exists

             Should not normally occur from commands.

        RAM disk does not exist

             The  RAMDISK  command was used to display  the  current
        size of the RAM disk, but no RAM disk exists.

        Read only file

             An  attempt  was  made to modify or  overwrite  a  file
        marked  as read only.  The DIR command shows this,  and  the
        ATTRIB command can make it not read only.

        Root directory full

             The   fixed  maximum  number  of  files  in  the   root
        directory  (often 64 or 112)  has been reached.  Directories
        do not have this limitation.

        System file exists

             An attempt was made to create a file which would, if it
        was  created,  overwrite a file that is marked as  a  system
        file.  System  files  are not used in MSX-DOS,  and are  not
        shown  by  the  DIR command or  accessible  from  any  other
        commands,  and  so this error should not normally occur with
        commands.

        Too many parameters

             All  the parameters a command expected were found on  a
        command line,  but there were still more parameters left  on
        the end of the line.

        Unrecognized command

             A  given  command  was  not an  internal command  or an
        external command  found along the current search path as set
        by the PATH command.

        Wrong version of command

             After  executing a program,  COMMAND2.COM tried to  re-
        load itself from the COMMAND2.COM file on disk, and found it
        was  not  the same version.  A prompt is  then  printed  and
        COMMAND2.COM will attempt to re-load itself again.

        Wrong version of MSX-DOS, system halted

             This  special  error  message is printed  when  MSX-DOS
        attempts to starts up and finds that some other part of  the
        MSX-DOS  system has a version number earlier than  required.
        As  the message suggests,  the computer must then be  reset.
        This should not normally occur.

             Internally,  errors  are represented as error  numbers.
        The  numbers corresponding to the errors above start at  255
        and decrease. If an error number is received for which there
        is  no  message,  then it is printed.  Numbers above 64  are
        reserved  for  future version of MSX-DOS and so  are  called
        'system errors' and numbers below 63 can be used by external
        commercially   available  programs  and  are  called   'user
        errors'. User errors below 32 never print a message. The two
        default  error messages (which will not normally occur  from
        commands) are thus:

        System error 64

             and

        User error 63

        where  the  64 and 63 are example error  numbers.  The  only
        command which uses error numbers is the EXIT command. A list
        of the actual numbers for the above messages is available in
        the Transient Program Interface specification.

PROMPT MESSAGES

             There are several situations in which user  interaction
        is  required before the system can continue with what it was
        doing,  typically  inserting a disk.  Also many  potentially
        dangerous  commands  require  confirmation  prompts  to   be
        answered before they perform their operation.  These various
        system prompts are given below.

        All data on drive A: will be destroyed
        Press any key to continue

             This  prompt  is given by the FORMAT  command,  and  is
        issued  to  reduce the risk of accidentally  formatting  the
        wrong  disk.  To abort the FORMAT command,  control-STOP  or
        control-C can be pressed.

        Destroy all data on RAM disk (Y/N)?

             A RAMDISK command was given to set up a RAM disk, but a
        RAM disk already existed.  If the response to the prompt  is
        'Y',  then  any  files  on this existing RAM  disk  will  be
        destroyed.  A  response of 'N' or control-STOP or  control-C
        will abort the command.

        Disk in drive A: will only be able to boot MSX-DOS
        Press any key to continue...

             This  prompt is given by the FIXDISK  command,  and  is
        issued  to  reduce the risk of accidentally updating a  non-
        MSX-DOS 2 disk.  To abort the FIXDISK command,  control-STOP
        or control-C can be pressed.

        Delete all files (Y/N)?

             This prompt occurs when a DEL command is given specify-
        ing all  the files  in a  directory, and is issued to reduce
        the risk of accidentally deleting a lot of files.

        Insert COMMAND2.COM disk in drive A:
        Press any key to continue

             This  may occur after running a program, and requires a
        disk containing  COMMAND2.COM in  the root  directory to  be
        present  in the specified drive. After inserting the disk in
        the drive (which is the drive from which MSX-DOS was origin-
        ally booted) and pressing a key, the system will continue as
        normal. If, for some reason, the file COMMAND2.COM cannot be
        found on the drive which it originally booted from, pressing
        a valid driveletter key will cause COMMAND2.COM to boot from
        another drive,  for example  a disk  drive instead of a hard
        disk.  If COMMAND2.COM has been copied somewhere else (eg. a
        RAM disk)  then the  SHELL environment item can be set up to
        make  COMMAND2.COM re-load  from there instead (see HELP ENV
        on Environment Items).

        Insert batch file disk in drive A:
        Press any key to continue

             This  may occur during the execution of a  batch  file,
        and  means  that the system needed to read the next  command
        from the batch file but found that the wrong disk was in the
        drive.  After  inserting  the disk in  the  specified  drive
        (which  will  be  the drive from which the  batch  file  was
        originally  started) and pressing a key,  execution  of  the
        batch file will continue as normal.

        Press any key to continue

             This   prompt  is  generally  issued  when  some   user
        interaction is required,  and is normally printed after some
        other  message  which describes the action required.  It  is
        also printed by the PAUSE command. To abort the command that
        issued the prompt, control-STOP or control-C can be pressed.

        Terminate batch file (Y/N)?

             When MSX-DOS aborts a command prematurely (such as when
        the  control-STOP  or  control-C key  is  pressed)  and  the
        command  was  executing  in a batch  file,  this  prompt  is
        issued. If the response is 'Y' then the batch file will also
        be aborted.  If 'N' is the response then the batch file will
        continue with the command that follows the aborted command.
