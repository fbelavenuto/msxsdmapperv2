MVDIR                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      MVDIR [/H] [/P] compound-filespec [path]

Purpose:     Moves directories from one place to another on a disk.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies which directories  are
        to be moved, and /H allows hidden directories to be included
        in the move.

             The second parameter specifies the directory into which
        the directories are to be moved, the current directory being
        used if this is not given. The path must exist on each drive
        referenced by the filespecs in the compound-filepec.

             If  a  particular directory cannot be  moved  into  the
        specified  or current directory (eg.  if a directory of  the
        same  name already exists) then the offending directory name
        is  printed  along  with an  error  message,  and  the  move
        operation continues with the next directory.  If many errors
        occur,  then the /P option will cause the output to pause at
        the bottom of the screen.

             Note  that it  is not possible to move a directory into
        one of its own descendant directories, as this would produce
        an invalid  sub-directory tree. An error is given if this is
        attempted.

Examples:

        MVDIR COM UTIL

             A  directory called COM and all descendant  directories
        and  files  are moved into a  directory  called  UTIL,  both
        directories  being  in the current directory of the  current
        drive.

        MVDIR \COM + \BAT  \UTIL

             A directory called COM and a directory called BAT,  and
        both their contents, are moved into a directory called UTIL.

        MVDIR E:DIR?/H/P ALL
        DIR2 -- directory exists

             All directories matching DIR? (eg. DIR1, DIR2 and DIR3)
        in  the current directory of drive E:,  which may be hidden,
        and  the  contents of these directories,  are moved  into  a
        directory  called  ALL.  A  directory  called  DIR2  already
        existed  in  ALL so the error was printed.  Neither  of  the
        DIR2 directories were affected at all.
