PATH                                                    [Compatible]
----

Format:      PATH [[+|-] [d:]path [[d:]path [[d:]path...]]]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the external command search path.

Use:         If  no parameters  are given, then the search path cur-
        rently  set  will  be  displayed,  separated  by semi-colons
        (';').

             If  + or - is not given,  then the search path will  be
        set  to the list of path names given and any existing search
        path will be deleted.

             If - is given before the list of paths,  then each path
        in  the list will be deleted from the currently  set  search
        path,  and  an error will be given if any of the given paths
        do not already exist.

             If + is given before the list of paths,  then each path
        specified  will  first  be deleted from  the  currently  set
        search  path if it exists,  and will then be added onto  the
        end.  This allows the order of the paths in the search  path
        to be changed and allows new paths to be appended to the end
        of the current search path. The + syntax can also be used to
        set  a search path longer than can be given in one  command,
        the  maximum length of the search path being 255  characters
        and the maximum length of a command 127 characters.

             When searching  for an external command file, the paths
        in  the current  search path will be used in order from left
        to right.  It is  recommended that  the paths  in the search
        path are specified as full paths starting at the root direc-
        tory  and with the drive specified. If this is not the case,
        then the  meaning of  the search  path could change when the
        current drive or directory is changed.

             The  search path is stored as an environment item  (see
        HELP ENV on Environment Items),  and so can also be accessed
        with the SET command.

Examples:

        PATH E:\COM E:\BAT

             When  an  external command  is next  searched for,  the
        directories searched  will be  the current  directory of the
        current  drive, the  COM directory  in the root directory of
        drive E:  and the  BAT directory  in the  root directory  of
        drive E:, in that order.

        PATH
        ; E:\COM; E:\BAT

             No parameters were given so the current search path was
        printed.

        PATH +A:\COM; A:\BAT

             The  directories A:\COM and A:\BAT are added to the end
        of the search path.

        PATH
        ; E:\COM; E:\BAT; A:\COM; A:\BAT

             The new search path is printed.

        PATH -E:\COM, E:\BAT

             The  directories E:\COM and E:\BAT are deleted from the
        current search path.

        PATH
        ; A:\COM; A:\BAT

             The new search path is again printed.
