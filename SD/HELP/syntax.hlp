SYNTAX NOTATION
---------------

             The  HELP command provides a description of the MSX-DOS
        commands using the following notation:

Words in upper case

             These are keywords and must be entered as shown in  any
        mixture of upper or lower case.

Items in lower case

             These  are  parameters  which must be supplied  to  the
        command at this point in the command line.

Items in square brackets ('[' and ']')

             These  are  optional  items.  The  brackets  themselves
        should not be included in the command line.

Items separated by a vertical bar ('|')

             This indicates that only one of the items is  required.
        The  vertical  bar  itself  should not be  included  in  the
        command line.

             The following is a list of items which can appear on  a
        command line:

d:

             This  indicates that a drive name is required  (A:,  B:
        etc.).

             If d:  is shown as optional and is not specified,  then
        the  currently logged-on drive,  as indicated by the command
        prompt, is assumed.

path

             This indicates that a directory path is  required,  the
        syntax of which is similar to MS-DOS.  Each directory in the
        path  is  separated by a backslash '\'.  A backslash at  the
        start of the path indicates that the path starts at the root
        directory,   otherwise  the  path  starts  at  the   current
        directory  as indicated by the CHDIR command.  Frequently  a
        filename  follows  a  path,  in which case the two  must  be
        separated by a backslash.

             Two consecutive dots '..' signify the immediate  parent
        directory  in  the  path.  A single dot  '.'  signifies  the
        current  directory in the path and therefore usually has  no
        value in a path specification.

             On  non-English MSX machines,  the backslash  character
        '\' may be replaced by some other character.  In particular,
        on Japanese MSX machines the Yen character is used.

             If  a  path is shown as optional and is not  specified,
        then the current directory as indicated by the CHDIR command
        is assumed.

             The  syntax of the directory names that make up a  path
        name follows that for filenames given below.

filename

             This indicates that the name of a file is required, the
        syntax  of  which  is similar to MS-DOS and  MSX-DOS  1.  An
        ambiguous  filename  is  one  that  contains  '*'  and   '?'
        characters and may match more than one file on disk,  whilst
        one that does not contain these is an unambiguous filename.

             A filename has the following syntax:-

               mainname[.[ext]]

             where mainname  is a sequence of up to 8 characters and
        suf is a sequence of up to 3 characters inclusive. Any char-
        acters  beyond these  fields are  ignored. A '*' in the main
        name or extension is equivalent to filling from that charac-
        ter position to the end of the field with '?'. If the exten-
        sion is  given then  it must be separated from the main part
        of the filename by a single dot '.'.

             The following characters cannot be used in filenames:-

             space : ; . , = + \ < > | / " ' ^ [ ]

             All  characters  are  converted  to  upper  case  where
        appropriate   and therefore lower and upper case  characters
        have  the  same meaning.  Note that  extended  two-character
        Japanese characters are allowed.

             If  a  filename  is  shown  as  optional  and  is   not
        specified, then a filename of *.* is assumed.

filespec

             This is used to identify a file or several files in the
        same directory on a disk. It's syntax is:-

                  [d:][path][filename]

        where  at  least  one of the three optional  items  must  be
        given.  Where this is used to specify existing files, /H may
        be given to allow hidden files to be found.

             Generally,  d:  if  not given defaults to the currently
        logged on drive,  path if not given defaults to the  current
        directory  of that drive and filename if not given  defaults
        to a filename of *.*.

compound-filespec

             This  is used in many commands to specify the files  or
        directories to which the command is applied. Its syntax is:-

                  filespec [+ filespec [+ filespec ...]]

             Thus  several  filespecs  (see  above)  can  be  given,
        separated  by '+' symbols,  with spaces etc. allowed  either
        side of the +. The effect of this in commands is exactly the
        same as if all the matched files could have been matched  by
        a single filespec.

             Where  a compound-filespec is used to specify  existing
        files,  /H  or  /S  may  be given  after each  filespec (see
        above), in which case it will take effect only for the files
        matched  by that  single filespec.  If a  /H or /S are given
        before the  compound-filespec, then  they will  apply to all
        the filespecs.

volname

             This indicates that a volume name is required. A volume
        name is a sequence of up to 11 characters, which can include
        the characters not valid for filenames with the exception of
        control  codes  and  '/',  although leading spaces  will  be
        deleted.

device

             This indicates one of the five standard MSX-DOS devices
        is required. These and their meaning are:

             CON  - screen/keyboard I/O
             NUL  - 'null' device, does nothing
             AUX  - auxiliary I/O (eg. RS232 serial)
             LST  - printer output
             PRN  - printer output

             Unlike on some other systems,  a colon is not  required
        after the device name.

             Device  names can generally be used wherever  filenames
        can be used.  For example,  the command COPY MYFILE PRN will
        read the file MYFILE and write it to the printer.

             When  using the CON device as an input filename,  lines
        can be typed in and edited in the same way as command  lines
        (see  HELP EDITING on  Editing Command Lines).  To  end  the
        operation,  control-Z  (^Z) must be typed at the start of  a
        line.  For example,  a small text file called MYFILE can  be
        created with the command COPY CON MYFILE.  Lines of text can
        then  be  typed  in,  and they will be written to  the  file
        MYFILE.   The  command  will  then  complete  when  a   line
        containing a single control-Z is entered.

             If  the NUL device is written to,  then the  characters
        written  are simply ignored.  If read from,  then an end-of-
        file   condition  is  returned  straight  away   (which   is
        equivalent to typing the control-Z in the example above).

             For  most  commands,  it is not sensible to  specify  a
        device  (the  CON  device  cannot be  deleted using  the DEL
        command, for  example). The commands that devices are likely
        to  be used  with those that read and write data from and to
        files, such as CONCAT, COPY and TYPE.

number

             This  indicates that a number is required.  This may be
        in  the  range  0  to 255 or 0 to  65535  depending  on  the
        command.
