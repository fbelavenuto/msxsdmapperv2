MD                                                      [Compatible]
--

Format:      MD [d:]path
                  or
             MKDIR [d:]path

Purpose:     Creates a new sub-directory.

Use:         The  last item in the path is the name of the new  sub-
        directory which is to be created on the default or specified
        drive.  Thus if this is the only item in the path,  the  new
        directory  is created in the current directory.  If the  new
        directory  is to be hidden,  then it must be separately made
        hidden with the ATDIR command.

             The  MD  command  is an abbreviated form of  the  MKDIR
        command provided for convenience and MS-DOS compatibility.

Examples:

        MKDIR UTIL

             A  directory  called  UTIL is created  in  the  current
        directory of the current drive.

        MKDIR A:\UTIL\RAM

             A directory called RAM is created in the UTIL directory
        in the root directory of drive A:.
