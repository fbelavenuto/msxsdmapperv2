TYPE                                                      [Enhanced]
----

Format:      TYPE [/S] [/H] [/P] [/B] compound-filespec | device

Purpose:     Displays data from a file or device.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies the files that are  to
        be displayed.  /H allows  hidden files  to be  typed and  /S
        alows  system files to be typed. If the compound-filespec is
        ambiguous, then  the filename  is printed before each one is
        typed.

             If  /B is specified,  then data is read from each  file
        and displayed without modification on the screen,  until the
        end of file is reached.  This may have strange effect on the
        screen if the file contains control characters.

             If /B is not given, then TYPE will look for the end-of-
        file  character  (CTRL-Z) and stop when it  finds  it.  Also
        control characters except carriage return, line feed and tab
        will be converted into a '^' symbol followed by that control
        letter so that they will be visible on the screen.

             If /P is given,  then the output will pause at the  end
        of the screen until a key is pressed.

Examples:

        TYPE FILE1

             Data  is read from the file and printed on the  screen,
        up to the first end-of-file character.

        TYPE *.BAT/H/P

             All batch files, including hidden ones, are read in and
        displayed.  A  prompt is printed at the end of every  screen
        full.

        TYPE AUTOEXEC.BAT + REBOOT.BAT

             The files AUTOEXEC.BAT and REBOOT.BAT are displayed.

        TYPE /B DIR1

             All  files  in the directory DIR1 are  printed  on  the
        screen  and  no  interpretation is put on the  data  in  the
        files.

        TYPE AUX

             Data  is  read from the AUX device (which may  be,  for
        example, an RS232 serial device) up to the first end-of-file
        character and printed on the screen.
