COPY                                                      [Enhanced]
----

Format:      COPY [/S] [/H] [/P] [/A] [/B] [/V] [/T] source dest

Purpose:     Copies data from files/devices to other files/devices.

Use:         The definition of the source is:

                  compound-filespec

        The  compound-filespec specifies the files or  devices  that
        are  to be copied.  If /H is given then hidden files may  be
        copied and if /S is given then system files may be copied.

             The definition of the dest is:

                  [d:][path][filename] | device

        where d: and path default to the current drive and directory
        respectively.  If any part of the filename is ambiguous then
        the  appropriate  character  from  the  source  filename  is
        substituted,  thus  allowing the files to be renamed in  the
        process.  If  the  filename is not given,  then  the  entire
        source  filename  is used.  If the dest  is  an  unambiguous
        directory,  then  the  files are copied into that  directory
        with a filename of *.*.

             COPY  will  read as many source files as possible  into
        memory before writing any out. When it can read no more into
        memory (eg.  when it has used all available memory) it  will
        write out each file in the order that it read them.  When it
        creates  each destination file,  it prints the source  file-
        name.  Then  if it is unable to create the destination file,
        an error message is printed and the copy operation continues
        with the next file. /P can be given to make the output pause
        at the end of the screen.

             Many reasons  exist for COPY to be unable to create the
        destination,  such as a read-only file already existing with
        the  same  name. Sometimes  COPY will  refuse to  create the
        destination because  the user  may have  made a mistake. For
        example,  a file  cannot be  copied onto  itself, or several
        files cannot  be copied onto one file. A 'Cannot create des-
        tination  file' error may be given if the destination of one
        file would  delete a  previous source file or a file already
        being  used for  something else (eg. the currently executing
        batch  file). A 'Cannot overwrite previous destination file'
        error results  if an  attempt is  made to copy many files to
        one  file. This  usually means that the intended destination
        was a directory, but that the name has been misspelled.

             If  /A is specified,  then an ASCII copy is  performed.
        This means that source files will only be read as far as the
        first   end-of-file   character  (CTRL-Z)  and   then   each
        destination   will  have  a  single  end-of-file   character
        appended to it.

             It is also possible to give a /A to the destination  or
        to any of the filespecs in the compound-filespec separately,
        in  which  case  it  applies only to  that  source  or  dest
        specification. Also /B may be given to reverse the effect of
        /A.

             The  /V option can be given to turn write  verification
        on  for  the  duration of the COPY command (see  the  VERIFY
        command). This will ensure that data is written correctly to
        disks but will slow the operation down.

             Normally, the destination files are given the same date
        and time as the source files.  However, the /T option can be
        given  to  cause the destination files to have  the  current
        date  and time.  The destination files will not be hidden or
        read-only, regardless of the attributes of the source files.
        The ATTRIB command can be used to change these.

             If COPY gives a 'Not enough memory' error then probably
        reducing the number of buffers (see the BUFFERS command)  or
        removing some environment items (see HELP ENV on Environment
        Items) will free up sufficient memory.

             Note  that the COPY command is simpler than that in MS-
        DOS  and  MSX-DOS  1 because  it  cannot  concatenate  (join
        together) files.  To do this,  a CONCAT command is available
        (see the CONCAT command).

Examples:

        COPY FILE1 B:

             The  file FILE1 is copied from the current directory of
        the current drive to the current directory of drive B:.

        COPY /H  MSXDOS2.SYS + COMMAND2.COM  B:

             The  two hidden files MSXDOS2.SYS and COMMAND2.COM  are
        copied to drive B:, thus making it a booting disk.

        COPY A:\DIR1 B:\DIR1 /V

             All files in the directory DIR1 from the root of  drive
        A: are copied to a similar directory on drive B: with verify
        on to ensure that the files were written correctly.

        COPY B:

             All  files  in the current directory of  drive  B:  are
        copied to the current directory of the current drive.

        COPY /A AUX CON

             Characters  are read from the device AUX (which may  be
        used for RS232 serial for example) to the device CON,  which
        is the screen.  The copy is done as far as the first end-of-
        file  character.  If /A was not given,  then there may  have
        been  no way of stopping the COPY operation without pressing
        the CTRL-STOP key.

        COPY A:*.DOC B:/T

             All  files  matching  *.DOC  (for  example   FILE1.DOC,
        FILE2.DOC and FILE3.DOC) are copied to the current directory
        of drive B:  and are given the current date and time instead
        of the dates and times of the *.DOC files.

        COPY *.BAT
        AUTOEXEC.BAT -- File cannot be copied onto itself
        REBOOT.BAT -- File cannot be copied onto itself

             This command told COPY to copy all files matching *.BAT
        (in  this case AUTOEXEC.BAT and REBOOT.BAT) from the current
        directory of the current drive to the same place,  and  COPY
        printed  the messages to warn of this.  No data in this case
        was actually copied.

        COPY *.BAT DIR2
        AUTOEXEC.BAT
        REBOOT.BAT -- Cannot overwrite previous destination file

             This command told COPY to copy all files matching *.BAT
        (in  this case AUTOEXEC.BAT and REBOOT.BAT) to  a  directory
        called DIR2.  DIR2,  however,  did not exist so AUTOEXEC.BAT
        was  copied to a file called DIR2,  and then an attempt  was
        made  to  copy REBOOT.BAT also to a file  called  DIR2.  The
        message was printed as a warning that a mistake was probably
        made  (in this case DIR2 not existing).  REBOOT.BAT was  not
        actually copied anywhere.
