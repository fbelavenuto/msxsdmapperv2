RMDIR                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      RMDIR [/H] [/P] compound-filespec
                       or
             RD [/H] [/P] compound-filespec

Purpose:     Removes one or more sub-directories.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies which directories  are
        to  be  deleted,  and  /H allows hidden  directories  to  be
        included in the delete operation.

             If  a directory cannot be deleted for some reason  (eg.
        it is not empty) then the name of the offending directory is
        printed  along  with  an  error  message,   and  the  delete
        operation continues with the next directory.  If many errors
        occur  then /P will cause the output to pause at the end  of
        the screen.

Examples:

        RMDIR DIR1

             The  directory called DIR1 in the current directory  of
        the current drive is removed.

        RD B:\COM + B:\BAT

             The  directories COM and BAT are removed from the  root
        directory of drive B:.

        RD \*.*
        UTIL -- Directory not empty

             An attempt was made to remove all directories from  the
        root directory of the current drive,  but a directory called
        UTIL  was not empty and so the error was printed.  UTIL  and
        its contents are not affected at all.
