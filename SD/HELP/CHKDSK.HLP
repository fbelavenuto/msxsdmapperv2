CHKDSK                                                  [Compatible]
------

Format:      CHKDSK [d:] [/F]

Purpose:     Checks the integrity of the files on the disk.

Use:         The  integrity  of the data structures on disk  in  the
        specified or current drive is checked and lost disk space is
        checked for.  When errors are found on the disk,  corrective
        action  is taken.  If lost clusters are found,  a prompt  is
        issued  allowing the lost disk space to be either  converted
        into  usable  disk  space or into files.  If the  latter  is
        chosen,  then files of the form  FILE0000.CHK,  FILE0001.CHK
        etc. will be created.

             If  the  /F option is not given,  then CHKDSK will  not
        actually  write any corrections it makes to disk,  but  will
        behave as though it has.  This allows CHKDSK to be  executed
        to see what would be done to the disk if /F was given.

             Disk space can become lost (i.e. lost clusters created)
        when some programs are aborted. This applies particularly to
        CP/M  programs.  It  is  recommended  that  CHKDSK  is  used
        occasionally on all disks.

             Note  that  this  is  a  transient  command,  and  must
        therefore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

        CHKDSK

             The  disk in the current drive is  checked.  A  'status
        report'  will  be  printed.  Any errors found  will  not  be
        written to disk.

        CHKDSK B:

             The disk in drive B:  is checked. Any errors found will
        not be written to disk.

        CHKDSK/F
        20 lost clusters found in 1 chain
        Convert lost chains to files (Y/N) ?

             The  disk  in the current drive was checked,  and  some
        lost disk space found.  Since /F was given,  the corrections
        will be written to disk and the lost space recovered.
