ECHO                                                    [Compatible]
----

Format:      ECHO [text]

Purpose:     Prints text in a batch file.

Use:         The text is simply displayed on the screen.  If no text
        is given, then just a blank line is output.

             This  command  should not be confused with  the  'echo'
        state in batch files,  which is controlled by an environment
        item called ECHO (see HELP ENV on Environment Items).

Examples:

        ECHO AUTOEXEC batch file executed
        AUTOEXEC batch file executed

             The specified text ('AUTOEXEC batch file executed') was
        printed on the screen.

        ECHO

             No  parameters  were given,  so just a blank  line  was
        printed.
