RAMDISK                                                 [Compatible]
-------

Format:      RAMDISK [number[K]] [/D]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the RAM disk size.

Use:         If  no parameters are given,  then the current  RAMDISK
        size is displayed as the number of kilobytes.

             The  number,  if given,  specifies the maximum size for
        the new RAM disk, and is specified in kilobytes. This figure
        will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 16K since  the
        RAM  disk  is always a multiple of 16K.  A RAM disk  smaller
        then  the specified maximum size may be created if there  is
        not  enough free memory for the full size,  although a  'not
        enough memory' error will be given if there is no memory  at
        all  available  for  the  RAM disk.  Note  that  the  number
        specified  is the maximum amount of RAM to use for  the  RAM
        disk,  which  is not the same as the maximum amount of  free
        space  available  on  the newly-created RAM disk  since  the
        system needs to use some.

             If  a  RAM  disk already exists before  a  new  one  is
        created, then a 'Destroy all data on RAM disk (Y/N)?' prompt
        is printed to avoid accidental loss of data. /D can be given
        which will automatically delete any existing RAM disk first,
        thus suppressing the prompt.

             Having  created a RAM disk,  it can be referred  to  as
        drive H:.

             The  RAMDISK  command  is  normally  only  used  in  an
        AUTOEXEC.BAT  batch file,  with a large number specified  so
        that  as large a RAMDISK as possible is created.  It is  not
        advisable to keep any data on a RAM disk except for a  short
        length of time that is not also kept on a floppy disk, since
        it will be lost if,  for example,  the power to the computer
        fails.

Examples:

        RAMDISK
        Ramdisk is 160K

             No  parameters  were  given,  so the  current  size  is
        printed, in this case 160K.

        RAMDISK
        *** RAM disk does not exist

             No  parameters  were  given but no RAM  disk  has  been
        created, so the error is given.

        RAMDISK = 300
        Destroy all data on RAM disk (Y/N)? y

             A RAM disk already existed,  so the prompt was printed.
        In this case,  the reply was 'y' so the current RAM disk was
        deleted and the new one set up with a maximum size of 300K.
