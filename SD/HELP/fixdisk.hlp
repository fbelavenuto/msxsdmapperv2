FIXDISK                                                 [Compatible]
-------

Format:      FIXDISK [d:] [/S]

Purpose:     Updates a disk to the full MSX-DOS 2 format.

Use:         The  default or specified drive specifies the drive  on
        which FIXDISK is to operate.

             This  command is mainly used to update MSX-DOS 1  disks
        to full MSX-DOS 2 compatibility,  but may also be useful for
        updating other disks of a similar format.

             Although  the disk format used by MSX-DOS 1 and MSX-DOS
        2  is standardized,  MSX-DOS 1 does not use the  information
        stored on certain parts of the disk (the boot sector) and so
        this  information  is not necessarily correct on  MSX-DOS  1
        disks.  This can cause problems when MSX-DOS 2 is used  with
        these disks.  Additionally, the MSX-DOS 2 UNDEL command will
        only  work  with disks that were formatted using  MSX-DOS  2
        (i.e. disks  that have a 'volume id' in the boot sector) and
        so will not work with MSX-DOS 1 disks or disks formatted  on
        other  systems.

             The FIXDISK command will correct the information on the
        boot sector so that these disks can be used with MSX-DOS 2.

             If /S option is also given, FIXDISK will update a  disk
        so that  it is  fully MSX-DOS 2 compatible, and its use will
        allow  full use  of MSX-DOS 2 disk features. When a disk has
        been updated in this way, however, it may no longer be fully
        compatible with the original system,  although it will still
        be  readable and writeable under that system.  For  example,
        if  a  FIXDISK command is used on an application disk  which
        directly starts up from the boot code, then that  disk  will
        no longer be able to boot that application.

             To  help prevent accidental updates of boot disks  from
        other systems, a prompt is issued before updating a disk.

             Note  that  FIXDISK is a transient  command,  and  must
        therefore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

        FIXDISK B: /S
        Disk in drive B: will only be able to boot MSX-DOS
        Press any key to continue...

             Drive  B:  will  be  updated  to  be  fully  MSX-DOS  2
        compatible.  Since  the disk may have been a boot disk  from
        another  system,  a  prompt  is issued before  the  disk  is
        actually updated.
