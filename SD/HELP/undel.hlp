UNDEL                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      UNDEL [filespec]

Purpose:     Recovers a previously deleted file.

Use:         The filespec specifies which files are to be  undeleted
        if possible, and defaults to *.*.

             Files  can only be undeleted if they have been  deleted
        using  MSX-DOS 2  on  an  MSX-DOS 2 formatted disk and if no
        disk  allocation  has  taken  place  since  the   file   was
        originally deleted, which usually means that they have to be
        undeleted immediately after they have been deleted.

             Each deleted file and directory reference that is found
        in the directory specified by the filespec will be undeleted
        if it's name is matched by the filename in the filespec, and
        if  undeletion is possible.  UNDEL can therefore be used  to
        restore  a  directory  removed  with  the  'RD'  or  'RMDIR'
        commands; to restore the contents of the directory a further
        UNDEL  command  is  required specifying  the  now  undeleted
        directory.

             Note  that UNDEL is a transient command,  and therefore
        must be loaded from disk.

Examples:

        UNDEL B:FRED.MAC

             Attempts  to  undelete  the  file  FRED.MAC  from   the
        current directory of drive B:.

        UNDEL A:\DIR1

             All  undeletable  files  and directories  in  DIR1  are
        undeleted.
