XCOPY                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      XCOPY [filespec [filespec]] [options]

Purpose:     Copies files and directories from one disk to another.

Use:         The options available are:

                   [/A] [/E] [/H] [/M] [/P] [/S] [/T] [/V] [/W]

             XCOPY is an extended file copying command (compare with
        the  COPY command) that can selectively copy both files  and
        directories.   The  first  filespec specifies   the   source
        filenames, and if /H is given then hidden files will also be
        copied.  The  second  filespec is the destination  filename.
        Thus  files  can  be  renamed during the  copy  (as  in  the
        standard COPY command).

             /T will cause the copied files to have the current date
        and time rather than the source file's date and time.

             If  /A is specified, then only files with the 'archive'
        attribute set are copied. A file has an archive attribute in
        the  same  way  as a 'hidden' attribute and  a  'read  only'
        attribute.  It  is set whenever a file is  updated  (written
        to).

             /M  is similar to /A,  but resets the archive bit after
        copying  the file.  Thus,  using this option,  files can  be
        regularly  copied onto another disk only if they  have  been
        updated, providing a file backup facility.

             /S  causes XCOPY to copy directories as well as  files.
        Within  each directory,  all files are copied and  then  any
        matching  files within each directory are copied,  with  the
        directory  being  created on the destination if it does  not
        already  exist.  Normally,  these  directories will  not  be
        created if no files are to be copied into them.

             /E  can  be given to cause the /S option to create  all
        directories, even if they are empty.

             The  /P  option  will cause XCOPY to pause  and  prompt
        before  copying  each  file,   which  allows  files  to   be
        selectively copied.

             /W  causes XCOPY to pause and prompt before copying any
        files, so that disks can be changed.

             The  /V option can be given to turn write  verification
        on  for  the duration of the XCOPY command (see  the  VERIFY
        command). This will ensure that data is written correctly to
        disks but will slow the operation down.

             Note that XCOPY is a transient command,  and so must be
        loaded off disk.

Examples:

        XCOPY B:\

             All files in the root directory of drive B:  are copied
        to the current directory of the current drive. There  is  no
        advantage  in  this case over  using  the standard  built-in
        COPY command.

        XCOPY *.* B: /H/S/M

             All  files, including hidden files, are copied to drive
        B: only  if they  have been modified since a similar command
        was last given. The files are then marked as unmodified. Not
        only  are all the files in the current directory copied, but
        so are  directories and all their descendant directories and
        files.
