DIR                                                       [Enhanced]
---

Format:      DIR [/S] [/H] [/W] [/P] [/2] [compound-filespec]

Purpose:     Displays the names of files on disk.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies which files are to  be
        listed.  If  the /H option is given,  then hidden files will
        also  be listed  and if  the /S option is given, then system
        files will also be listed.

             In  the DIR command,  unlike all other commands,  it is
        permissible  to not give the main filename or  the  filename
        extension,  and both will default to '*'. Thus a filename of
        'FRED' is equivalent to 'FRED.*' and a filename of '.COM' is
        equivalent to '*.COM'.  Note that if the '.' at the end of a
        main  filename is given,  then the extension is also assumed
        to  have  been given,  so that the filename 'FRED.'  is  not
        equivalent to 'FRED.*', unlike the example above.

             There  are three  formats of the listing. If the /W op-
        tion is given, then a 'wide' listing is printed, with sever-
        al  filenames  output  per  line. Sub-directory  names, file
        attributes, and  the date and time each file was created are
        not displayed.

             If  the /W option is not given,  then the filenames are
        printed  with  one  filename per  line,  together  with  the
        attributes, the file size and the date and time at which the
        file was last modified. The attributes are printed as an 'r'
        if  the file is read-only and an 'h' if the file  is  hidden
        (and  /H is  given) and  an 's' is the file is a system file
        (and /S  is given).  If the time of a file is zero (i.e. the
        file  does not  have an associated time) then the time field
        will not  be printed.  If the  date of  a file is zero, then
        neither  the date  nor the  time fields will be printed. The
        formats in  which the  dates and times are printed in can be
        changed (see HELP DATE and HELP TIME).

             The  non-/W  display  is designed to fit  within  a  40
        column screen,  but if fewer columns are available then some
        fields  of the listing will not be shown so that the display
        will  always fit on one line.  The number of files per  line
        that  are  printed  when /W is specified  is  also  adjusted
        according  to the screen width.  If the width of the display
        is less than 13 characters however,  then in both cases  the
        filenames will wrap to the next line.

             If  the  /2  option  is given,  then the  filenames are
        printed  with  two  filenames  per line.  The /2  display is
        designed to  fit within  a 80  column screen,  but if  fewer
        columns  are available  then some fields of the listing will
        not be  shown so  that the  display will  always fit  on one
        line.

             At the top of the list of files, the volume name of the
        disk  and  the  name  of  the  directory  being  listed   is
        displayed.  At the bottom,  the number of files listed,  the
        total  number  of  bytes  in the files  and  the  amount  of
        remaining disk space is printed.

             When  the directory of a sub-directory is printed,  the
        first   two  items  listed  will  always  be   two   special
        sub-directories called '.' and '..'. These are automatically
        created  when  a new directory is created,  and it is  these
        that allow '.' and '..' to be given in path names to signify
        the  current and parent directories respectively  (see  HELP
        SYNTAX for a description of paths).

             When  printing  a  number  of  bytes,   the  number  is
        truncated  and  printed as the number of kilobytes if 1K  or
        greater.

             If the /P option is given,  then the output will  pause
        at the bottom of the screen until a key is pressed.

Examples:

        DIR

             All  filenames  and  directory  names  in  the  current
        directory of the current drive will be printed.  This  might
        be as follows:

              Volume in drive A: is MSX-DOS 2
              Directory of A:\

             MSXDOS2  SYS r    4096 86-06-19  2:45p
             COMMAND2 COM r   10496 86-06-19  2:46p
             UTILS           <dir>  86-06-19  2:50p
             HELP            <dir>  86-06-19  2:50p
              14K in 2 files   222K free

        The   disk  thus  contains  the  two  MSX-DOS  system  files
        MSXDOS2.SYS and COMMAND2.COM,  which are read only,  and two
        directories called UTILS and HELP.

        DIR B:\HELP/W

             A  'wide'  directory format has been requested  of  the
        HELP directory on drive B:. This might be as follows:

              Volume in drive B: is MSX-DOS 2
              Directory of B:\HELP

             BUFFERS .HLP    ATTRIB  .HLP    ASSIGN  .HLP
             ATDIR   .HLP    CHDIR   .HLP    CD      .HLP
             SYNTAX  .HLP    ENV     .HLP    BATCH   .HLP
             EDITING .HLP
              25K in 10 files   222K free

        DIR  UTILS + HELP/P

             This will list all the files in the UTILS directory and
        all  the files in the HELP directory,  and will pause at the
        end of every screen full.

        DIR .COM

             No main filename was given,  and so defaults to *. Thus
        this command is equivalent to the command DIR *.COM.

        DIR COMMAND2

             No extension was given,  so this defaults to  .*.  Thus
        this command is equivalent to the command DIR COMMAND2.*.
