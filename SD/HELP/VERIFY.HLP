VERIFY                                                  [Compatible]
------

Format:      VERIFY [ON | OFF]

Purpose:     Displays/sets the current disk write verify state.

Use:         If  no parameters are given,  then the  current  verify
        state is displayed on the screen.

             If ON or OFF is given, then the verify state is changed
        appropriately.

             The  verify state affects all writes to disk.  If  OFF,
        the default state,  then data is simply written. If ON, then
        after writing the data it is read back and compared with the
        original to ensure that it was written correctly.  The extra
        overhead of this means that writing is slower when verify is
        on.

Examples:

        VERIFY
        Verify is OFF

             No   parameters  were  given,   so  the  current verify
        state is printed, which in this case is off.

        VERIFY ON

             Disk write verification is turned on.
