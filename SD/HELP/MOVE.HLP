MOVE                                                      [Enhanced]
----

Format:      MOVE [/S] [/H] [/P] compound-filespec [path]

Purpose:     Moves files from one place to another on a disk.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies which files are to  be
        moved. /H allows hidden files to be included in the move and
        /S allows system files to be included in the move.

             The path specifies the directory to which the files are
        to be moved, the current directory being used if this is not
        given.  The  path must exist on each drive referenced by the
        filespecs in the compound-filespec.

             If a particular file cannot be moved into the specified
        or current directory (eg. if a file of the same name already
        exists) then the offending filename is printed along with an
        error  message,  and the move operation continues  with  the
        next  file.  If many errors occur,  then the /P option  will
        cause the output to pause at the bottom of the screen.

Examples:

        MOVE FILE1 \

             The  file FILE1 is moved from the current directory  of
        the  current  drive  to the root directory  of  the  current
        drive.

        MOVE /H /P E:*.COM \
        COMMAND2.COM -- File exists

             All files matching *.COM,  both hidden and not  hidden,
        in  the current directory of drive E:  are moved to the root
        directory  of  that drive.  The  file  COMMAND2.COM  already
        existed  in  the root directory,  so the error was  printed.
        Neither of the COMMAND2.COM files were moved or altered.  If
        many  such errors had occurred then a prompt would have been
        printed after a screen full.

        MOVE \UTIL\*.COM + \UTIL\*.BAT

             All files matching *.COM or *.BAT in a directory called
        UTIL on the current drive are moved to the current directory
        of that drive.
