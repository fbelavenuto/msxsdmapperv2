XDIR                                                    [Compatible]
----

Format:      XDIR [filespec] [/H]

Purpose:     Lists all files within directories.

Use:         The  filespec specifies which files are to  be  listed,
        and /H allows hidden files to be included.

             XDIR is similar to the DIR command,  but does not print
        the files' dates and times.

             After  all  files in the specified directory have  been
        listed,  then  files within descendant directories are  also
        listed,  and  are  shown indented.  This allows a DIR  of  a
        complete directory tree or disk to be obtained.

Examples:

        XDIR

             The directory of the  entire disk in or descending from
        the current directory of the current drive is printed.

        XDIR B:\DIR1

                     All   the  files  and  directories  and   their
        contents are printed from the directory DIR1.

        XDIR \*.COM/H

             The  names  of  all  files,   including  hidden  files,
        matching *.COM are displayed.
