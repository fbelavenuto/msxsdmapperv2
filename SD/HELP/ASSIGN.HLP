ASSIGN                                                  [Compatible]
------

Format:      ASSIGN [d: [d:]]

Purpose:     Sets up the logical to physical translation of drives.

Use:         If  no  drives  are  given,   then  all  current  drive
        assignments are cancelled.

             If only one drive is given,  then the physical drive to
        which this refers is printed.

             If both drives are given,  then the first drive is  the
        drive  which MSX-DOS currently uses,  and the second is  the
        drive which MSX-DOS will subsequently use.

Examples:

        ASSIGN

             Un-assigns all previous drive assignments.

        ASSIGN A: B:

             Assigns drive A: to drive B:, so that all accesses that
        previously would go to drive A: go instead to drive B:

        ASSIGN A:
        A:=B:

             Displays  the drive to which A:  is currently assigned,
        which in this case is B:.
