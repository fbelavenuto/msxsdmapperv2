RENAME                                                    [Enhanced]
------

Format:      RENAME [/S] [/H] [/P] compound-filespec filename
                  or
             REN [/S] [/H] [/P] compound-filespec filename

Purpose:     Renames one or more files.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies  the files that are to
        be renamed.  /H allows  hidden files  to be  included in the
        rename  operation and  /S allows system files to be included
        in the rename operation.

             The  second  filename specifies the new  name  for  the
        files.   A   '?'   in  the  new  name  indicates  that   the
        corresponding character from the filename being renamed will
        be used,  thus allowing an ambiguous rename. Thus '*' in the
        second  filename,  which is just equivalent to a  series  of
        '?'s,  indicates that the whole of the filename or extension
        will remain unchanged.

             If  for some reason a particular file cannot be renamed
        (eg.  if  a  file  or directory with the  new  name  already
        exists)  then the offending filename will be  printed  along
        with an error message and the rename operation will continue
        with the next file. If many errors occur, then /P will cause
        the output to pause at the end of the screen.

Examples:

        RENAME FILE1 FILE2

             The  file FILE1 in the current directory of the current
        drive is renamed to FILE2.

        RENAME B:\DIR1\*.DOC/H/P *.OLD
        FILE2.DOC -- File exists

             All  files matching *.DOC in the directory called  DIR1
        in the root directory of drive B:,  including hidden  files,
        are renamed with the same main name but with an extension of
        .OLD.  The file FILE2.DOC could not be renamed because there
        was already a file called FILE2.OLD in the directory, so the
        error  was  printed.  Neither  FILE2.DOC nor  FILE2.OLD  was
        altered at all. If many such errors had been printed, then a
        prompt would have been printed at the bottom of every screen
        full.

        RENAME DOC + FILE1 *.OLD

             All  files  in the directory called DOC  and  the  file
        FILE1,  both  in the current directory of the current drive,
        and renamed with an extension of .OLD.
