TIME                                                    [Compatible]
----

Format:      TIME [time]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the current time.

Use:         If  the time is given after the command,  then the time
        is set to this value (for the format see below). If the time
        is  not given after the command,  then the current  time  is
        printed  and the new time is prompted for and input.  If  no
        input  is  given (i.e. if the 'enter' key alone is  pressed)
        then the current time is not altered. Otherwise the input is
        assumed  to be a new time,  and is interpreted as  described
        below.  If  the  time is invalid then an  error  message  is
        displayed and the new time again prompted for and input.

             The  time is expected to consist of up to four numbers,
        separated by one of the following characters:

             space tab , - . / :

        with  spaces  allowed  either side  of  the  character.  Any
        missing  numbers will default to the  current  setting.  The
        first  number is the hour,  the second is the  minutes,  the
        third is the seconds and the forth is the centi-seconds. The
        centi-seconds  are not printed however since it is not  very
        useful to know the current value,  or indeed to enter a  new
        one.

             The format in which the time is printed is flexible and 
        can  be  changed.  An  environment  item  (see  HELP  ENV on 
        Environment Items)  called TIME  is set up by default to the 
        value '24', which indicates that the time will be printed in 
        24 hour mode. The command SET TIME 12 will cause the time to 
        be printed in 12 hour format with a following 'a' or 'p' for 
        am  and pm.  The time  can be  input unambiguously in either 
        format. The  time format  also affects  the times printed by 
        the DIR command.

Examples:

        TIME 16:45

             The current time is set to 4:45 pm.

        TIME
        Current time is 10:45:58a
        Enter new time:

             No  parameters  were  given,  so the  current  time  is
        printed   (in this case in 12 hour mode) and  the  new  time
        prompted for.

        TIME 10-50-30-23

             The time is set to 30.23 seconds after 10:50 am.
