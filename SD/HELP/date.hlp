DATE                                                      [Enhanced]
----

Format:      DATE [date]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the current date.

Use:         If the date is given after the command,  then the  date
        is set to this value (for the format see below). If the date
        is  not  given after the command,  then the current day  and
        date is printed and the new date is prompted for and  input.
        If  no  input  is given (i.e. if the 'enter'  key  alone  is
        pressed) then the current date is not altered. Otherwise the
        input  is  assumed to be a new date,  and is interpreted  as
        described  below.  If  the  date is invalid  then  an  error
        message is displayed and the new date again prompted for and
        input.

             The date is expected to consist of up to three numbers,
        separated by one of the following characters:

             space tab , - . / :

        with  spaces  allowed  either side  of  the  character.  Any
        missing  numbers  will default to the current  setting.  The
        year may either be a full century and year,  or may be  just
        the  year  in which case the century defaults to 19  if  the
        year is greater than 80 or 20 otherwise.

             The  format  in which the date is printed and input  is
        flexible and can be changed. An environment item called DATE
        is set up by default to a format that is appropriate for the
        country  of  origin  of the MSX machine  (see  HELP  ENV  on
        Environment  Items).  For example,  on Japanese machines the
        default setting is YY-MM-DD.  The command SET DATE  DD-MM-YY
        will  change  the date format to the UK format.  The  format
        also affects the dates printed by the DIR command.

             If  the DATE environment item is defined,  then it will
        be  printed  by the DATE command to indicate the  format  in
        which the date is required to be input.

Examples:

        DATE 86-6-18

             The current date is set to the 18th June 1986.

        DATE
        Current date is Wednesday 1986-06-18
        Enter new date (yy-mm-dd): - -19

             No  parameter  was given,  so the current date of  18th
        June  1986 was printed and a new date prompted for.  In  the
        reply to the prompt, the date was updated to the next day by
        only specifying the 19th.  Since the year and month were not
        given, they remained the same.

        SET DATE = DD/MM/YY

             The date format has been changed to the UK format.

        DATE
        Current date is Thursday 19-06-1986
        Enter new date (DD/MM/YY):

             No  parameter was given,  so the current date  of  19th
        June  1986  was  printed in the UK format,  and  the  prompt
        printed. The reply is expected in the UK format.
