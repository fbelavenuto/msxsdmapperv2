KMODE                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      KMODE number|OFF
                or
             KMODE [number|OFF] /S [d:]

Purpose:     Sets  or resets  'Kanji Screen  Mode', or  updates boot
        code so that it automatically installs Kanji Driver and then
        selects screen mode.

Use:         Number specifies the  'Kanji Screen Mode'.  The  number
        ranges  from  0  to  3 and has the same meaning as its BASIC
        counterpart  'CALL  KANJI<n>'  statement.   Specifying   OFF
        restores  screen  mode  to  ANK  (MSX  native screen modes).
        Unless Kanji Driver is installed (by  typing  CALL  KANJI<n>
        statement  from  BASIC  or  automatically  by 'Kanji Boot'),
        screen modes will not change.

             If the /S option is specified then the boot code of the
        default or specified drive is updated. In this case, if mode
        is  not specified then current screen mode is used. When the
        disk is  updated in  this way,  the boot code will always be
        'Kanji  Boot' and  the disk  will no  longer be able to boot
        MSX-DOS 1.

             To  help prevent accidental updates of boot disks  from
        other systems, a prompt is issued before updating a disk.

             Note that  KMODE  is  a  transient  command,  and  must
        therefore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

        KMODE 3

             'Kanji screen mode' will be set to 3 if  'Kanji driver'
        is installed.

        KMODE OFF

             Screen mode is set back to native MSX text screen.

        KMODE /S B:
        Disk in drive B: will only be able to boot MSX-DOS 2
        Press any key to continue...

             Drive B: will be updated to 'Kanji Boot'.  Since 'Kanji
        Boot'  will not boot anything from disk,  a prompt is issued
        before the disk is actually updated.

             Booting from  this disk  will automatically install the
        Kanji  Driver and then set screen mode, in this case, to ANK
        (i.e. screen mode will not alter).
