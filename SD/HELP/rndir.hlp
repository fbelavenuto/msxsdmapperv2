RNDIR                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      RNDIR [/H] [/P] compound-filespec filename

Purpose:     Renames one or more sub-directories.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies the  directories  that
        are  to be renamed,  and /H allows hidden directories to  be
        included  in  the  rename operation.  The  contents  of  the
        directories remain unchanged.

             The  second  filename specifies the new  name  for  the
        directories.  A  '?'  in  the new name  indicates  that  the
        corresponding character from the name of the directory being
        renamed  will  be used,  thus allowing an ambiguous  rename.
        Thus '*' in the second filename, which is just equivalent to
        a series of '?'s,  indicates that the whole of the  filename
        or extension of the directory name will remain unchanged.

             If  for  some reason a particular directory  cannot  be
        renamed (eg.  if a file or directory of the new name already
        exists)  then the offending directory name will  be  printed
        along  with  an error message and the rename operation  will
        continue with the next directory. If many errors occur, then
        /P will cause the output to pause at the end of the screen.

Examples:

        RNDIR UTIL COM

             The  directory called UTIL in the current directory  of
        the current drive is renamed COM.

        RNDIR A:\*.*/H/P *.OLD
        UTIL -- Directory exists

             All  directories,  hidden and not hidden,  in the  root
        directory of drive A: are renamed with an extension of .OLD.
        The  directory UTIL could not be renamed because a directory
        called UTIL.OLD already existed,  so the error was  printed.
        If  many  such  errors were printed then /P  would  cause  a
        prompt to be printed at the end of every screen full.

        RNDIR COM + BAT *.OLD

             The  directories COM and BAT are renamed to COM.OLD and
        BAT.OLD respectively.
