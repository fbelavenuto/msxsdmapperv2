DEL                                                       [Enhanced]

Format:      DEL [/S] [/H] [/P] compound-filespec
                  or
             ERA [/S] [/H] [/P] compound-filespec
                  or
             ERASE [/S] [/H] [/P] compound-filespec

Purpose:     Deletes one or more files.

Use:         The  compound-filespec specifies which files are to  be
        deleted.  The  /H  option  allows hidden files  to  also  be
        deleted and the /S option allows system files to be deleted.

             During  the  delete  operation,  if a  file  cannot  be
        deleted for some reason (eg.  it is set to 'read only') then
        the  offending  filename  is printed  along  with  an  error
        message,  and  the delete operation continues with the  next
        file.  If  many such errors occur,  then the /P option  will
        cause the output to pause at the end of the screen.

             If the filename is *.*, then the prompt:

                  Delete all files (Y/N) ?

        is  printed,  and  a reply is waited for.  If the  reply  is
        anything other than 'Y' or 'y',  then the file deletion does
        not take place. This is a safety feature designed to prevent
        accidental loss of all files in a directory.

             If files are deleted unintentionally on a disk that was
        formatted  under  MSX-DOS 2,  then the UNDEL command may  be
        used immediately afterwards to restore them again.

Examples:

        DEL FILE1.BAK

             The   file  FILE1.BAK  is  deleted  from  the   current
        directory of the current drive.

        DEL *.COM/H

             All  files matching *.COM,  both hidden and not hidden,
        are deleted.

        DEL B:\UTIL\*.COM + B:\UTIL\*.BAT

             All files matching *.COM or *.BAT are deleted from  the
        directory called UTIL on drive B:.

        DEL B:\UTIL
        Delete all files (Y/N)?

             All files in the directory called UTIL on drive B:  are
        deleted.  Since so many files are being deleted, a prompt is
        printed first to prevent a catastrophe.

        DEL *.BAT
        AUTOEXEC.BAT -- Read only file
        REBOOT.BAT -- Read only file

             All  files  matching  *.BAT  are  deleted  except   for
        AUTOEXEC.BAT  and REBOOT.BAT which have been marked as  read
        only.
