EXIT                                                    [Compatible]
----

Format:      EXIT [number]

Purpose:     Exits COMMAND2.COM to the invoking program.

Use:         The number is an error code and defaults to 0, which in
        MSX-DOS indicates no error (see HELP ERRORS).

             EXIT  exits the command interpreter (COMMAND2.COM)  and
        returns the error code to the program that originally loaded
        and  executed  it (see the COMMAND2 command).  This  may  be
        another   COMMAND2.COM,   another  program   or,   normally,
        MSXDOS2.SYS.  In  the  latter  case,  an  appropriate  error
        message will be printed and COMMAND2.COM simply reloaded and
        executed.

             COMMAND2.COM when loaded saves the current  environment
        (see HELP ENV on Environment Items),  and EXIT restores  it.
        Thus, when  EXIT exits  back to MSXDOS2.SYS, the environment
        will be cleared. COMMAND2.COM will then be reloaded and will
        set  up the default environment again, providing a method of
        resetting the environment to its default values.

Examples:

        EXIT

             The  command interpreter is exited.  What happens  next
        depends on what loaded it.

        EXIT 40
        *** User error 40

             The command interpreter is exited with an error code of
        40. Since this does not correspond to an error that is known
        to  the  system,  the error message is printed  by  whatever
        loaded  the  command  interpreter in the  first  place  (see
        HELP ERRORS).
