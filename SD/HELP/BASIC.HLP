BASIC                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      BASIC [program]

Purpose:     Transfers control to MSX disk BASIC.

Use:         Program is the name of a BASIC program on disk.

             Control is passed to the built-in MSX BASIC, which will
        load  and execute the BASIC program if specified.  If a  RAM
        disk has been set up, then it can still be used from BASIC.

             The  BASIC  command _SYSTEM("command") can be  used  to
        return to MSX-DOS,  and the optional command,  which can  be
        any command mentioned in this manual,  will be executed.  If
        the  command  is  not  given,   then  a  batch  file  called
        REBOOT.BAT  will be  searched  for  and  executed  (see HELP
        BATCH on Batch Files).
