VOL                                                     [Compatible]
---

Format:      VOL [d:][volname]

Purpose:     Displays or changes the volume name on a disk.

Use:         If no parameters are given,  or if only a drive name is
        given,  then  the  volume name of the current  or  specified
        drive  is printed.

             If  a  volname is given,  then the volume name  of  the
        specified  or  current  drive is changed  to  the  specified
        volume name.

Examples:

        VOL B:
        Volume in drive B: has no name

             Just   a drive was given,   so the volume name for  the
        disk  in that drive is printed.  In this case there  was  no
        volume name defined.

        VOL B:BACKUP

             The   volume   name  of the disk   in   drive   B:   is
        changed to BACKUP.
