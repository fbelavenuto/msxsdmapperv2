BUFFERS                                                 [Compatible]
-------

Format:      BUFFERS [number]

Purpose:     Displays  or changes the number of disk buffers in  the
        system.

Use:         If  the number is not given,  then the number  of  disk
        buffers currently in the system will be displayed, otherwise
        the  number  of  buffers will be changed  to  the  specified
        number, the now unused memory being freed for other purposes
        if the new number is less than the previous. If there is not
        enough  memory for the specified number of buffers,  then as
        many as possible are created and no error is given.

             Increasing the number of disk buffers may speed up some
        applications,   particularly   those  that  perform   random
        accesses to files.  Setting the number above 10 is  unlikely
        to  improve  performance  much,  and unnecessarily  uses  up
        memory.

             The  memory area used for disk buffers is also used for
        environment  items  and  for  opening  files.  Thus  keeping
        buffers  set  to  the  maximum  possible  may  prevent  some
        commands from working, particularly SET, COPY and CONCAT. If
        any of these commands give a 'not enough memory' error  then
        it  may help to reduce the number of buffers.  Reducing them
        below   about   three  however   will   impair   performance
        considerably.

             The default number of buffers in the system is 5, which
        will be adequate for most purposes.

Examples:

        BUFFERS
        Buffers is 5

             The current number of disk buffers is printed, which in
        this case is 5.

        BUFFERS 10

             The  number  of  buffers is increased  to  as  many  as
        possible up to a limit of 10.

        BUFFERS = 5

             The number of buffers is reduced again to 5.
