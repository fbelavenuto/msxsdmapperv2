PAUSE                                                   [Compatible]
-----

Format:      PAUSE [comment]

Purpose:     Prompts and waits for a key press in a batch file.

Use:         The  comments  consists  of an  arbitrary  sequence  of
        characters.

             The  comment,  if  given,  is printed  followed by  the
        prompt 'Press  any key  to continue  ' on the next line. The
        system  will then wait for a key to be pressed and will echo
        the  key  pressed  if  it is  a printable  character. If  no
        comment is  given as  a parameter, then just the prompt will
        be printed.

             The  main use of this command is to issue prompts  from
        within a batch file.

Examples:

        PAUSE
        Press any key to continue

             No comment was given, so just the prompt was printed.

        PAUSE Insert document disk in drive B:
        Insert document disk in drive B:
        Press any key to continue

             The  comment  given was 'Insert document disk in  drive
        B:' so this was printed followed by the prompt.
